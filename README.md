- Abstraction layer for static text
- Supports iOS and Android
- Demonstrates how to define UI elements that are common across pages (e.g. menu bar, side bar, etc.)
- How to recover from test failure/ how to write fail safe test cases
- Scrolling for both Android and iOS (using touchaction, uiScrollable, mobile:scroll)
- Demonstrates how to effectively capture Screenshots/Videos
- Supports parallel execution on multiple real Android and iOS devices
- Integrated with Log4J2 Logging framework (supports basic as well as parallel logging)
- Integrated with Extent Reporting framework (supports parallel, screenshots, logging test steps)
